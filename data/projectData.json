Without access to nearby schools, many families are not able to educate their children. Integral Heart delivers a safe container for education, cleanliness, laughs, and love, as children are able to just be children while simultaneously being intellectually stimulated. While they are being taught the fundamentals of reading and writing, they also learn to appreciate the value of maintaining personal hygiene. Integral Heart takes care of each child's nutrition, physical health, and emotional growth."
