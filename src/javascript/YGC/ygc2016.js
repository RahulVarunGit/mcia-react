    <h6 >My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style.’ -Maya Angelou. It is 16 year old Nia R. Gilbert’s daily goal to embody these wise words from the great Maya Angelou. Born in the corny (figuratively and literally) central Illinois, Nia was birthed into a large family. Hundreds of cousins, sisters, brothers, and God-Family. A large support system. They supported her through elementary school when she learned that she had an inner arousing enthusiasm for competitions and- specifically- winning them. They supported her through junior high when she learned that she had the talent and mindset to be a winner, leader, and teammate, but was struggling to accept her environmental surroundings. They’ve been supporting her through high school when she realized that she could change her environmental surroundings each summer with some cash, a plane ticket, and a plan. Though her family provided her with the strong foundation of love, strength, humility, and a sense of purpose, she had always felt like a big fish in a small puddle. So when the opportunity to spend the summer before her junior year in New York City presented itself, Nia jumped at the chance. Because of the opportunities the summer provided her- from an internship with a NYC council member’s office to learning how to be more independent- Nia came back to her “puddle” with a higher level of determination, awareness, and passion. Nia is involved in many different organizations, clubs, and programs. She enjoys listening to music, dancing, working, and exercising. She is excited for her future and spends every day preparing for it with the support and encouragement from her family.</h6>

Growing up in America, Suhrud moved from one state to another from the age of three to the age of six. At the age of six, Suhrud settled in Bloomington, Illinois.

There, he made friends and established relations with teachers and staff. In the summer of 2009, Suhrud had to move from a town home in Bloomington, to a house in Normal. As he lived in Normal, he realized that not only did he like the Twin Cities, he liked the community as well! The primary reason as to why he adored the community, was because of the kind, generous people it had. On that day, a sense of giving back and helping others came into his mind. From that day onward, Suhrud decided that he’d take action and contribute by being part of organizations that help charities, ensure the cleanliness of streets and more! His main goal is to help others, in order to make a positive impact on their lives and to serve the community.</h6>
