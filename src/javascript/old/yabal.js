    <h5 className="center-align justify"><i >Yabal Guatemala promotes the empowerment of indigenous women and their families in rural Guatemalan highland communities through a focus on their economic self-sufficiency. Yabal believes that women are the center of the family and home with the greatest influence over the success of their children- the future generation of the community. Yabal Guatemala focuses on the economic independence of women, education, food security, and the promotion of entrepreneurship as paths towards sustainability and poverty reduction for rural indigenous communities.</i></h5>
    <h5 className="center-align justify"><i >Yâ€™abal will expand their food security program through a chicken raising project in the Guatemalan communities of Pacutama and Chuicutama. This project will provide local families with a source of protein as well as income for the women in the community. This funding will provide the initial purchase of the baby chicks, the construction of chicken coops, materials for chicken feed, and vaccinations. A separate donor will provide funding for training the community members to raise and care for the chickens.</i></h5>
